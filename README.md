# DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)

This repository contains a collection of C/C++ programs implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms. It is organized by topic for easy navigation and learning.

## Folder Structure

- **Array**
  - Array-based algorithms and problems (e.g., pair finding, wave array, special problems)
- **Basic**
  - Basic programming exercises (e.g., string manipulation, array sum, matrix operations)
- **Linked Lists**
  - Implementations and problems on singly, doubly, and merged linked lists
- **Queue**
  - Queue implementations using arrays and linked lists
- **Searching & Sorting**
  - Classic searching and sorting algorithms (e.g., binary search, bubble sort, insertion sort)
- **Stack**
  - Stack implementations and stack-based problems (e.g., infix to postfix, valid parentheses)
- **Tree**
  - Binary tree implementation and related algorithms
